			<h2><span><time>10/02/2015</time> </span>: Living Spiritually in a Conscious World</h2>
			<p>Spiritual living begins with looking at day-to-day events differently. 			   Instead of judging things by how important they are on the scales of worldly accomplishment, you focus on the depth of meaning behind the outer appearances of everything in your life.</p>

			<h2><span><time>10/02/2015</time></span> : Letting life be meaningful</h2>
			<p>Every moment of life is meaningful. Every person you encounter has an important movement in your dance. Every object you can see right now, wherever you are, is profoundly full of deeper significance and meaning. In this amazingly prolific universal creation, everything around you is inherently and naturally in perfect harmony with who you are and what you think and feel.</p>
